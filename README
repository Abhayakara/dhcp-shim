This repo contains a set of code that can be used to build relay
agents that modify DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 packets in transit.  This is not
entirely compatible with the DHCP protocol and in particular will
break in the presence of DHCP signing.   Nevertheless, this can be
useful for testing and prototyping.

6relay.c contains a DHCPv6 relay agent that does some magic to
allow a single prefix allocation on the DHCPv6 server to be replicated
as several colored prefixes for the client.

tra6to4.c is a DHCPv4 relay agent that relays DHCPv4 packets
over IPv6, in order to support an old version of DHCPv4-over-IPv6
that didn't get standardized.

This code may or may not be of any use at all to anyone other than
its original users, but if you find it helpful, please use it and
let us know.  You will almost certainly have to hack it to make it
do something--it is unlikely that what it does at the moment is
what you need.
